Welcome to the third installment in the Jupyter Supplemental Exercise series of the UP Data Science Society. 

In this workshop, we shall introduce you to the second Python package, pandas. This package contains so much useful functions to allow you to spreadsheet files, tables from a resource, etc.

### Section 1: Getting Started with pandas
We will begin by introducing the pandas package, a brief history of the package and give an idea on what kind of manipulations it can do to make your life easier and faster and how to get started. By the end of this section, you'll be all set to dive into the world of data manipulation with pandas!

### Section 2: pandas Series and DataFrame
In this section, we will discuss the building blocks of the pandas library -- Series, DataFrame, and Index classes. We shall also explore how to work with those and when it is best to use. After this section, you will be able to create DataFrames and perform operations on series and dataframes to better inspect and filter your data.

### Section 3: Data Wrangling
We'll focus on preparing our data for analysis through a process known as data wrangling. We'll cover techniques for cleaning and restructuring the data, such as renaming columns and resolving data type inconsistencies. Additionally, we'll explore methods for reshaping and enriching the data, including discretizing columns, computing aggregations, and integrating multiple data sources.

### Section 4: Hands-On Exercise
We will practice all that you’ve learned so far through a hands-on exercise. This notebook will only give the context and questions for which you will have to apply the lessons from the previous sections.
