    "* a Series is similar to a single column of data while,\n",
    "* a DataFrame is like your usual rows and columns whenever you open a spreadsheet\n",
    "* you can also think that a DataFrame is a collection of several Series objects to form your rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start on discussing Series and DataFrame as it will prove to be helpful in the succeeding lessons on to know how and when the best use-case scenario for each kind for any of those two data structures. We will definitely spend a long time with this to ensure that you will understand how pandas work and how to effectively use the package."
